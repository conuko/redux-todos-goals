# My Goals and Todos

My Goals and Todos is a small web application that allows you to add, toggle and delete
todos and goals.
The app is connected to a fake-API which randomly displays an error message now and then. This is intentional and only serves to illustrate how React and Redux can handle error messages from an API.

My Goals and Todos was built with React, Redux, Redux Middleware, react-redux and tailwindcss.
